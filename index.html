                <p><strong>Your Privacy Matters.</strong> Pomodoro Focus Timer is built with your privacy in mind. We don't collect, store, or share your personal information. This app works entirely on your device.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Pomodoro Focus Timer ("the App", "we", "us", or "our") handles your information. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our practices.</p>

            <h2>Information We DON'T Collect</h2>
            <p>Pomodoro Focus Timer does not collect, transmit, or share any of the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Personal identification information (name, email, phone number, etc.)</li>
                <li>Location data</li>
                <li>Device identifiers or advertising IDs</li>
                <li>Usage analytics or behavioral data</li>
                <li>Your focus session data or statistics</li>
                <li>Any other personal or sensitive information</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Data Storage</h2>
            <p>All data generated by the App is stored locally on your device and never transmitted to external servers. This includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Timer Settings:</strong> Your customized session lengths and break durations</li>
                <li><strong>Productivity Statistics:</strong> Your daily focus session counts and completed pomodoros</li>
                <li><strong>App Preferences:</strong> Theme selection (light/dark mode) and notification settings</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This data remains entirely on your device and is under your control. If you uninstall the App, all this data is automatically deleted.</p>

            <h2>Permissions</h2>
            <p>The App may request the following permissions to function properly:</p>
            
            <h3>Notifications</h3>
            <p>Used to alert you when a focus session or break ends. You can control notification settings through your device settings at any time.</p>
            
            <h3>Vibration</h3>
            <p>Used to provide haptic feedback when timers complete, enhancing the notification experience.</p>
            
            <h3>Prevent Phone from Sleeping</h3>
            <p>Ensures the timer continues to run accurately when the screen is off during a session.</p>

            <p><strong>Important:</strong> None of these permissions are used to collect or transmit any data. They are solely for the App's core functionality.</p>

            <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>Pomodoro Focus Timer does not integrate with any third-party analytics services, advertising networks, or data collection platforms. The App operates completely independently without any external connections.</p>

            <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>Our App does not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13 (or the applicable age in your jurisdiction). Since we don't collect any personal information from anyone, the App is safe for users of all ages.</p>

            <h2>Data Security</h2>
            <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device and never transmitted over the internet, the security of your data depends on your device's security measures. We recommend:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Keeping your device's operating system up to date</li>
                <li>Using device lock features (PIN, password, biometric)</li>
                <li>Being cautious about granting device access to others</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the App or legal requirements. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.</p>
            
            <p>If we make material changes that affect how we handle data (though currently we don't handle any personal data), we will notify you through the App or via the App's store listing.</p>

            <h2>Your Rights</h2>
            <p>Since we don't collect or store any of your personal information on our servers, there is no data for us to access, modify, or delete. You have complete control over all App data stored on your device:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Access:</strong> All your data is on your device and accessible through the App</li>
                <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> Clear app data through your device settings or uninstall the App</li>
                <li><strong>Portability:</strong> Your data stays on your device and never needs to be transferred from our servers</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR)</h2>
            <p>For users in the European Union, this section explains our legal basis for processing information. However, since we don't collect or process any personal data, GDPR obligations related to data collection don't apply to our App. The App processes data locally on your device with your consent through your use of the App.</p>

            <h2>California Privacy Rights (CCPA)</h2>
            <p>For California residents: Since we don't collect, sell, or share personal information, the CCPA's disclosure requirements don't apply. You maintain complete control over all data stored locally on your device.</p>

            <h2>International Data Transfers</h2>
            <p>Since no data is collected or transmitted from your device, there are no international data transfers to disclose.</p>
